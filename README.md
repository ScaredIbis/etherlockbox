# Ether Lock Box

## What is it?

[etherlockbox](https://app.etherlockbox.com) is a dApp that allows users to create m-of-n security question backups for their ETH.

## Why?

Users can store ETH long term without having to worry about remembering or storing a private key. As long as they can remember the answers to the security questions, the funds will be accessible. This can be used as a way to store ETH in your brain. It can also be used to leave ETH for people that know nothing about private keys, such as in wills or as gifts.

### Unlocking Period
Lockboxes can be set up with an Unlocking Period which gives the original owner a window to reclaim funds after a lockbox is unlocked. This window of time is represented by a number of blocks.

### Spendable Once Unlocked
By default, lockboxes can be spent from at any time by the owner while the lockbox is still locked. Once unlocked, only the address that correctly answered the security questions can redeem the funds, unless configured otherwise during creation.

### Spending Value From A Lockbox
Any address that has access to a lockbox (either by owning it or unlocking it) is able to transfer value out of the lockbox to a given address. The user can choose how much value to spend from the at the time of spending.

### Adding Value To Existing Lockboxes
Any address can add funds to any lockbox at any time if they know the id of the lockbox
